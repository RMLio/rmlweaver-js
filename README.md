**RMLWeaver-JS** is a Node.js algebraic mapping engine that works 
in tandem with **[AlgeMapLoom-rs](https://github.com/RMLio/algemaploom-rs/)**.
RMLWeaver-JS executes the mapping processes described by the mapping plan 
generated by AlgeMapLoom-rs.
Based on RX-JS streams, RMLWeaver-JS maps the heterogeneous data to RDF
knowledge graphs in streaming manner. 
This results in an overall lower memory usage. 

## Disclaimer 
***This implementation is used as a platform for fast iterations of implementing the underlying algebraic formalisms!***

## Usage

### Execute a Dot File

To execute a dot file, use:

Example
Execute a dot/ttl file with:

```
npm run execute_dot ${file}
```

To run in debug mode add argument -debug
Like

```
npm run execute_dot -- ${file} -debug
```

### Execute tests
RML test cases, for CSV input, are located under the folder [`./test/rml-mapper-test-cases-csv/`](./test/rml-mapper-test-cases-csv/). 

ShExML test cases are located under the folder [`./test/shexml/`](./test/shexml/). 

To execute the tests, use:

```
npm test
```

## Future works:

-   LeftJoin and RightJoin.
-   More file types for source and target.
-   (Not Sure) Fix that extend operator does not push a value if the value for the template is missing. (Test 2c)
-   Optimize code
-   Write benchmarks.
